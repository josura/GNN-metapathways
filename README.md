# Graph Neural Networks and Gene metapathways
1. Received the expression matrices
2. Finished the first part of genes embeddings with two different types of models since the data has different features.

# preliminary steps
After the decompression of the datasets, the column names should be changed to be conform to the ones in brca\_clinical.txt, e.g. for the tumor expression matrices, the \_01 at the end of the column names should be removed
